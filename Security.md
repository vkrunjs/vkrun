<h2 id="reporting-a-bug">Reporting a bug</h2>

The team takes all Vkrun security bugs seriously. Thank you for
improving the security of Vkrun. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to recognize
your contributions.

Report security bugs by sending an email to the main maintainer
in the README-pt.md file.

To ensure a timely response to your report, please make sure the
entire report is contained within the body of the email and not
just behind a web link or attachment.

The main maintainer will confirm your email within 72 hours and
send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next
steps in handling your report. After the initial response to your
report, the security team will strive to keep you informed about
progress towards a fix and full disclosure, and may request
additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team
maintaining the module.

<h2 id="disclosure-policy">Disclosure Policy</h2>

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will
assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the
fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the issue and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit the code to find potential similar issues.
  * Prepare fixes for all versions still in maintenance. These
    fixes will be released as soon as possible to npm and yarn.
